Zero is built using the zkSync Stack, which is optimized to be as close to the Ethereum EVM as possible. Almost every smart contract written for EVM will be supported by Zero and will hold all key security invariants.

However, there are still some minor differences between the behavior of Zero and Ethereum that you should be aware of when building apps on top of Zero.

You can learn more about [EVM differences here](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/differences-with-ethereum.html).
