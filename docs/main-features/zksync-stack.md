# zkSync Stack

### Ethereum L2[](https://docs.base.org/docs/#ethereum-l2)

ZERϴ is built as an Ethereum L2, with the security, stability, and scalability you need to power your onchain apps.

### Powered by zkSync

ZERϴ Network leverages the zkSync Hyperchain’s zk rollup technology to offer fast and gasless transactions.

Hyperchains are “fractal-like instances of zkEVM running in parallel and with the common settlement on the L1 mainnet.” They benefit from Ethereum’s security in full and aim to further support ecosystem decentralization. The zk Stack currently boasts the only native Account Abstraction and helps ZERϴ build our own sovereign zk Chain without sacrificing interoprability and composability.
