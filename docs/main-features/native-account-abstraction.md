# Native Account Abstraction on ZERϴ

In ZERϴ, accounts can both initiate transactions like an externally owned account (EOA) and incorporate complex logic similar to a smart contract. This is known as Account Abstraction. Users can expect gasless transactions with intuitive fast bridging across various networks.

### AA and Paymasters on ZERϴ

Native Account Abstraction, introduced on ZKsync Era, improves account functionality through the concepts of Smart Accounts and Paymasters. Smart Accounts are entirely programmable, offering features like signature schemes, spending caps, multi-sig features, and app-specific restrictions.

Since ZERϴ is built on zkSync Hyperchain’s zk rollup technology, it inherits the same AA features. 

> ZERϴ will be one of the first EVM-compatible chains to implement zkSync’s native account abstraction (AA).

Paymasters can cover transaction costs for users, allowing fees to be paid in ERC20 tokens. This account management approach improves onchain user experience, security, and flexibility. 

In addition to the default zkSync accounts, we will add our paymaster, which enables free transactions for Zerion Wallet users.
