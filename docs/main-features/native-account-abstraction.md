### AA and Paymasters on Zero

In Zero, accounts can both initiate transactions like an externally owned account (EOA) and incorporate complex logic similar to a smart contract. This is known as account abstraction. Users can expect gasless transactions with intuitive fast bridging across various networks.

The introduction of native Account Abstraction in zkSync Era improves account functionality through the concepts of Smart Accounts and Paymasters. Smart Accounts are entirely programmable, offering features like signature schemes, spending caps, multi-sig features, and app-specific restrictions. 

Paymasters can cover transaction costs for users, allowing fees to be paid in ERC20 tokens. This account management approach improves onchain user experience, security, and flexibility.

In addition to the default zkSync accounts, we will add our paymaster, which enables free transactions for Zerion Wallet users.
