When building a decentralized application (dApp) on Zero Network, developers should approach the creation of transactions as they would on a standard blockchain. However, when the dApp is accessed through a Zerion Wallet, it automatically leverages the Zero Paymaster. This feature ensures that these transactions are free for the end-users, greatly enhancing the user experience. The best part? There is no additional configuration required on the part of the developer when using Zerion Wallet / Zero Paymaster. This simple and seamless integration is what makes building dApps on Zero Network a developer-friendly process.

However, use of custom paymasters is also possible. The design of accounts on Zero Network is the same as on zkSync Era, so its paymasters can be easily reused (see [how to deploy a smart-contracts to Zero](https://www.notion.so/How-to-deploy-a-smart-contract-to-Zero-9f588025f21e4373837c081f32342eee?pvs=21)). Zerion Wallet will display these transactions correctly, too.
