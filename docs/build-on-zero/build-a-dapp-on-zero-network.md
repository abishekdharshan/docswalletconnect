# Building a Dapp on ZERϴ Network

When building a decentralized application (dApp) on ZERϴ Network, developers should approach the creation of transactions as they would on a standard blockchain. However, when the dApp is accessed through a Zerion Wallet, it automatically leverages the ZERϴ Paymaster. This feature ensures that these transactions are free for the end-users, greatly enhancing the user experience. 

The best part? There is no additional configuration required on the part of the developer when using Zerion Wallet / ZERϴ Paymaster. This simple and seamless integration is what makes building dApps on ZERϴ Network a developer-friendly process.

The use of custom paymasters is also possible. The design of accounts on ZERϴ Network is the same as on zkSync Era, so its paymasters can be easily reused (see [how to deploy a smart-contracts to Zero](https://www.notion.so/How-to-deploy-a-smart-contract-to-Zero-9f588025f21e4373837c081f32342eee?pvs=21)). Furthermore, Zerion Wallet will display these transactions correctly too.
